* React/Lens TODO app

[[./images/app.png]]

** Goals
- Learn how to build component-based React apps by building a fairly full featured todo app.
- Apply Looker's Lens library to provide a nice consistent styling for your todo app. (Bonus points if you *only* use Lens components)
- Learn about some basic state management techniques by applying the Redux pattern to your todo app.

** You should try and build a todo app that supports the following features:
1. List active todos.
2. Complete todos by clicking on them (or using a checkbox). Remove todo from active list when completed.
3. Be able to see completed todos. Show the date when the todo was completed.
4. Remove todos that you are mistakes and/or want cleared from list.

** Structure
This top level directory has a few directories.  The directory `start_here` includes a skeleton project
where you will begin your work. There is a README in that subdirectory that will give you instructions on how
to get get going

This top level directory also includes a few reference implementations of the todo app that you can use if you get
stuck. I do provide a disclaimer that I wrote thenm fairly quickly and do not guarantee they will be production
quality. I have tried to document my code as much as possible for educational purposes.  If yuo find any glaring errors,
please let me know!

** Helpful references
Here a few helpful references for you as you build out your todo app.

1. [[https://reactjs.org/][ReactJS]] - Probably the best starting point for learning how to build React apps
2. [[https://lens.looker.com/][Lens Docs]] - Catalogues and documents all Lens components you can use your in your app
3. [[https://redux.js.org/][Redux]] - One of many state management tools you might choose to make your app more predictable and robust.  I have provided a reference app using Redux if you are interested.
4. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34_L7t7fD_U][Simple made easy]] - Not directly related to this project,  but you should strive to make your components and app simple. Learn about what that means here.
