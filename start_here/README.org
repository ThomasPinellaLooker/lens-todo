* Setting up skeleton project

** Install Yarn
[[https://yarnpkg.com/en/][Yarn]] must be installed.  If yo don't have yarn installed , have a look at [[https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install][here]] and choose the appropriate installation for your environment.

** Configure gradle.properties file
Lens needs to connect to Looker's private npm registry, powered by Nexus. Lens has some scripts that take care of this setup automatically, 
but they assume that some setup from Helltool has already been completed, specifically configuration of a gradle.properties file.

If you have Helltool installed and running, you've likely already setup your gradle.properties file to connect to our Nexus server. 
[If not take a look at the relevant Helltool directions and follow them so you can get the 
Nexus server username and password first](https://github.com/looker/helltool#dependencies).
